Before we dive too deep into this, let’s lay out a some of the things you need to know about blogging with GitHub Pages:

- GitHub Pages uses software called “Jekyll” to handle all the fancy stuff behind the scenes. Jekyll is what converts your blog post files into nicely formatted HTML that you can view in the browser. Jekyll is capable of doing a TON of great stuff, but for now, that’s really all you need to know.
- Blog post files should always be named using this format: `yyyy-mm-dd-your-blog-post-name.md`
- A post written on `September 3rd, 2022`, would be named `2022-09-09-my-blog-post.md`. _Be careful not to use future dates because the post won’t show up._
- Posts are written in markdown, if you don’t know it, don’t worry, there’s not much to it. [See this post](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) by GitHub to learn some of the basics.

That’s about all you need to know to get started.
